> Cross-instance share page for Mastodon

[toot] allows you to share stuff on Mastodon, cross-instance. Just put in your post text and the instance URL and click â€˜Toot!â€™

And if you open this page with `text` URL parameter, it will be auto-inserted in the text field. The same goes for the `instance` URL parameter. This can be used to build custom share buttons for Mastodon:

```html
<a href="https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=Hello%20world!&instance=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.xyz">
  Share on Mastodon
</a>
```

The instance URL can be saved in your `localStorage` to be automatically appended later â€” handy!

## Hosting

### One-click Vercel deploy

For now, toot is a tad bit vendor-locked to run on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/). To deploy it yourself, you can use the following
button:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNickKaramoff%2Ftoot)

### Host it yourself

Self-hosting toot outside of Vercel requires some extra setup:

1. Make sure you have got Node.js v12 or later installed

2. Build the static part of toot:

   ```sh
   yarn        # to install dependencies
   yarn build  # to build the website
   ```

3. Run the backend server for the form:

   ```sh
   node api/toot.js
   ```

4. Set up a reverse proxy from `localhost:8000` to `/api/toot`
