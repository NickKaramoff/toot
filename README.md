> Instance-agnostic share page for the Fediverse.

**[Share₂Fedi]** (pronounced ‘share-to-fedi’) allows you to share stuff on
Mastodon, Misskey, Friendica, and other federated social networks,
instance-agnostic. Just type in the post text and the instance URL, and click
‘Post!’

Or, open this page with the prefilled `text` URL parameter—it will be
automatically inserted into the text field. The same goes for the `instance` URL
parameter. This can be used to build custom share buttons for the federated
social networks:

```html
<a href="https://s2f.kytta.dev/?text=Hello%20world!&instance=mastodon.xyz">
  Share on mastodon.xyz
</a>
```

The instance URL can be saved in your `localStorage` to be automatically
appended if used later—handy!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I know I provide [a Share₂Fedi instance](https://s2f.kytta.dev) for others to
> use, but if you want to use Share₂Fedi for your share buttons, **please
> consider self-hosting it**. Although it's free now, running my instance may
> become too expensive for me in the future.

## Hosting

### Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages

**Share₂Fedi** was designed to run on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), but you can
also run it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). To deploy it yourself (it's
free!), you can use the following buttons:

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkytta%2Fshare2fedi)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/kytta/share2fedi)

To deploy to Cloudflare Pages, fork the repo and
[follow the instructions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/cloudflare/#how-to-deploy-a-site-with-git).

### Host it yourself

Self-hosting **Share₂Fedi** outside of Vercel requires some extra setup:

**Prerequisites:** modern Node.js (v16 or later), `pnpm`. You can host with
Deno, but Node.js is still required.

1. Install dependencies.

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Build.

   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

   If you want to use Deno, add the `--s2f-use-deno` flag:

   ```sh
   pnpm build --s2f-use-deno
   ```

3. Run server.

   > By default, this will only listen on localhost port 3000. To enable
   > listening on a ceratin host and/or port, set the `HOST` and `PORT`
   > environment variables, respectively.

   ```sh
   node dist/server/entry.mjs
   ```

   In production, you might want to use a process manager, like
   [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/):

   ```sh
   # Start the app, restart on file changes (except node_modules)
   pm2 start dist/server/entry.mjs --name "Share2Fedi" --watch --ignore-watch="node_modules"
   ```

   > https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#standalone

   If you've built Share₂Fedi for Deno:

   ```sh
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env ./dist/server/entry.mjs
   ```

4. Set up a reverse proxy.

   Basically, you need to run a reverse proxy that would redirect all incoming
   requests to `localhost:3000`. Here's how to achieve this in various HTTP
   servers:

   1. Apache

   ```apacheconf
   ProxyPass "/" "http://localhost:3000/"
   ```

   2. Nginx

   ```nginxconf
   location / {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
   }
   ```

   3. Caddy

   ```caddy
   reverse_proxy :3000
   ```

### Docker

If you _really_ have to use Docker, there is
[a good guide on building Astro apps with Docker](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/docker/).
**I will not** provide support for Docker-based deployments in the observable
future.
